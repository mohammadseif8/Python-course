## 🧩 Course Content

The heart of this repo lies in its structured sections, starting with the **"01-basic"** folder—a goldmine of Python fundamentals! Here’s what’s waiting for you in **"01-basic"**:

- **Data Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans—the essentials!  
- **Operators**: Math, comparisons, and logic made simple.  
- **Conditional Statements**: Decision-making with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.  
- **Loops**: Master `for` and `while` for smooth repetition.  
- **Strings**: Slice and dice text with ease.  
- **Lists**: Your go-to for dynamic data storage.  
- **Tuples**: Immutable lists with a twist.  
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value magic for quick access.  
- **Sets**: Unique collections, lightning-fast.  
- **Functions**: Clean, reusable code blocks.  
- **Recursive Functions**: Solve problems with recursion flair.  
- **Lambda Expressions**: Quick, one-line function tricks.  
- **Exception Handling**: Keep crashes at bay with `try` and `except`.  
- **Files**: Read and write like a pro.  
- **Regular Expressions**: Text wrangling with regex power.  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, and more!  

Then, level up with the **"02-Python Object Oriented Programming"** folder, where you’ll unlock the power of OOP:  
- **Classes & Objects**: Build blueprints and instances for reusable code.  
- **Inheritance**: Reuse and extend code with parent-child relationships.  
- **Encapsulation**: Keep data safe and tidy with access control.  
- **Polymorphism**: Flexibility to use methods in multiple forms.  
- **Dunder Methods (Magic Methods)**: Customize behavior with `__init__`, `__str__`, and more.  
- **Operator Overloading**: Redefine operators like `+` or `*` for your objects.  
- **Static & Class Methods**: Use `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` for utility and class-level logic.  
- **Abstract Classes**: Define blueprints with the `abc` module for must-implement methods.  

Every topic across both folders comes with **beginner-friendly examples** to turn theory into action, making even the trickiest concepts a breeze to grasp!
